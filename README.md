# Majoras-Mask-Tracker
Tracks items obtainable in Majora's Mask, and includes features such as sounds, saving, a reset button, and tooltips for item names!

**Please read:**

mmTracker just contains the Python code to read the program. It contains several dependancies and cannot run on its own.
Check Releases for an easy to use .zip file which contains all the necessary dependancies.

If you would like to run the program from Python, all the dependancies will be included here as well.
