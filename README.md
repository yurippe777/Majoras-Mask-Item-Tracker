# Majoras-Mask-Tracker
Tracks items obtainable in Majora's Mask, and includes features such as sounds, saving, a reset button, and tooltips for item names!

**Please read:**

mmTracker just contains the Python code to read the program. It needs the image and text files available in the correct locations to run. 
The attatched .zip file contains all the files needed to run the program from Python, or you can just use the .exe file included.
